# Golden Corpus Fixtures

This folder is the packet corpus for regression tests.

Format:
- one packet per file
- bytes written as hexadecimal pairs separated by spaces
- lines starting with `#` are comments and ignored

Current files are seed fixtures for the loader/validator harness.
As real captures are collected, add them here and keep filenames stable.
